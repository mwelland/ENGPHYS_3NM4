# Welcome

This online textbook is associated with the course EngPhys 3NM4 at McMaster University.

This book is an introduction to numerical methods. The main themes are:

*   Decomposing complex problems into simpler ones.
*   Boiling everything down to a simple task (e.g., solving a linear system of equations).
*   Approximating functions as weighted sums of simpler functions (a linear basis).
*   Expanding functions as Taylor series.
*   Achieving higher order accuracy by:
    *   approximating higher order derivatives.
    *   cancelling over and under prediction by averaging.

A recurring theme is that AI is fast. Use your head before the computer or it will run away with you!
