Decompose into simpler problems. 

This is an introduction to the book. Below are the main sections:

* Boil everything down to a simple task (linear system of equations)
* Approximate functions as weighted sums of simpler functions (a linear basis)
* Expand functions as Taylor series 
* Achieve higher order accuracy by 
* * approximating higher order derivatives.
* * cancelling over and under prediction by averaging.
