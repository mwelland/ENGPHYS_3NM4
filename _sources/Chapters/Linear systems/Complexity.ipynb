    "The *computational complexity* of an algorithm characterizes the number of operations it requires (thus comparing the algorithm instead of the hardware). Linear algebra algorithms are characterized in terms of the dimension of their arguments (vector length, matrix size, etc). Complexity is represented in big O notation (similar to the accuracy of function approximations). I.e.: Only the leading order is kept, and constants disregarded."
